# Madgwick_Quaternion_Filter_Unit
The Madgwick Quaternion Filter Unit (MQFU) is a high-performance FPGA-based hardware accelerator designed for real-time inertial attitude estimation. This project implements the Madgwick Quaternion Filter using fixed-point arithmetic, significantly improving throughput and reducing processor workload compared to software-based implementations.
